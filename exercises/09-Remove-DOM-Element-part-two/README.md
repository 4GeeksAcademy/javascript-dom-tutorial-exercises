It is possible to retrieve all the childs of a DOM element, for that you need to use the the `childNodes` property of the element. For example:

```js
    let list = document.querySelector("#myList");
    let childs = list.childNodes;   
```

## üìù Instructions:

1. Using the `childNodes` property, delete the second LI from the `#parentLi` list.

## üí° Hints:

+ `childNodes` returns an array of `li`, you can access the second element of that array and remove it from the DOM.
