# `07` Create DOM list of li

A great way to create HTML structures for your website is to concatenate several HTML strings in a single, bigger html string and then, append that string to the `innerHTML` of any element that is already a part of the HTML. For example:

```js
    let htmlString = '<div>' + 'Hello World' + '</div>';
```
## 📝 Instructions:

1. SET the `liststring` variable with the value needed to have the following HTML as the `#myDiv's`innerHTML:

```html
    <ul>
        <li>First Item</li>
        <li>Second Item</li>
        <li>Third Item</li>
    </ul>
```

### 💡 Hint:

Remember that the white spaces and indentation are ignored by the browser's interpreter.
