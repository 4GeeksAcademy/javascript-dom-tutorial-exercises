User interactions normally require changes in the DOM. We use events for that. If you don't feel comfortable with events please complete all the exercises on this classroom: https://repl.it/teacher/classrooms/4169

Instructions

Using the createElement function, create a DIV container with yellow background and "Hello World" as innerHTML, append that DIV into the body of the website when the users clicks on the #superDuperButton

Hint:
- get the button with the getElementById function
- Add a click event listener to the #superDuperButton
- Inside of that listener function, add the needed code to create the element and appended to the body as a child.

Expected result:
