# `10` Render on Click

User interactions normally require changes in the DOM. We use **events** for that. 
If you don't feel comfortable with **events** please complete first all [the exercises here](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-events-tutorial-exercises).

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Using the `createElement` function, create a `div` container with `yellow` background and "Hello World" as `innerHTML`.

2. Then append that `div` into the `body` of the website when 
the users clicks on the `#superDuperButton`

### 💡 Hint:

- Get the button with the `getElementById` function.

- Add a click event listener to the `#superDuperButton`.

- Inside of that listener function, add the needed code to create the element and appended to the body as a child.

### Expected result:
