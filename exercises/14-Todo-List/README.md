# `14` Todo List

This todo list design is pure css. The css and html is ready, but we need to code the Javascript part of the application. 

As you can see, when you initially run, the ability to delete or add items to the to-do list does not yet exist!

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Please add the `"delete task"` and `"add task"` functionality.

### :mag_right: Important:

You don't have to edit anything from the HTML nor the CSS, only the javascript!

### 💡 Hint:

- Analize the HTML code, how the list is design and built, what do you have to add into the HTML if you want a new item appear inside the list?

- If we were to delete any particular element, we would have to listen to the click handler on the trash icon and then delete the entier `li` in which the icon is included: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+delete+an+li+form+a+list+js
