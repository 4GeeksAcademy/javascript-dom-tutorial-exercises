# `09` Render on Click

User interactions normally require changes in the DOM. For that we use: **events**. 

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Using the `createElement` function, create a `div` container with `yellow` background and "Hello World" as `innerHTML`.

2. Then append that `div` into the `body` of the website when the users clicks on the `#superDuperButton`.

## Expected result:

## 💡 Hints:

+ Get the button with the `getElementById` function.

+ Add a click event listener to the `#superDuperButton`.

+ Inside of that listener function, add the needed code to create the element and appended to the body as a child.
