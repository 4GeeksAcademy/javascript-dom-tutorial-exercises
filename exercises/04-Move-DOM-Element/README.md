# `04` Move DOM Element

You can change any of the CSS properties whenever you want. Since CSS has some properties that defined the position of an object, that means you can use Javascript to change the position of an object.

## 📝 Instructions:

In this exerrcise, the `#wulu div` is floating to the left by default. Using Javascript, please change the float css property and make it float to the RIGHT.
