This tutorial is part of a bigger group of tutorials about web development, this repository focuses only on The DOM.

## You will learn the following concepts:

1. How to select elements from your website.

2. Manipulate them with Javascript (change styles, add event listeners).

3. Remove elements programmaticall.

4. Change your entire website without a refresh.

I strongly recommend doing this the tutorials in this order:

1. [Introduction to HTML](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/html-tutorial-exercises-course)
2. [Introduction to CSS](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/css-tutorial-exercises-course)
3. [Introduction to Javascript](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-beginner-exercises-tutorial)
4. [Introduction to The DOM](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-dom-tutorial-exercises) ← you are here now 🔥
5. [Using events & The DOM](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-events-tutorial-exercises)
6. [Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/object-oriented-javascript-tutorial-exercises)

## One click installation (recommended):

You can open these exercises in just a few seconds by clicking: [Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/javascript-dom-tutorial-exercises) (recommended) or [Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/javascript-dom-tutorial-exercises).

> Once you have VSCode open the LearnPack exercises should start automatically. If exercises don't run automatically you can try typing on your terminal: `$ learnpack start`

## Local Installation

1) Make sure you have [learnpack](https://github.com/learnpack/learnpack-cli) installed and `node.js` version v14+ and jest v27. This is the command to install the learnpack-cli and jest:

```sh
$ npm i learnpack jest@27.0.6 -g
```

2) Clone or download this repository. Once you finish downloading, you will find a new folder with a subdirectory "exercises" that contains all the exercises within.

3) Install the learnpack plugin to test and compile vanillajs:

```sh
$ learnpack plugins:install learnpack-dom
```

4) Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command from the root of the project:

```sh
$ learnpack start
```

<!-- endhide -->

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small vanillajs website containing the following files:

1. **index.js:** represents the entry javascript file that will be executed when the website loads.
1. **index.html:** represents the HTML entry for website.
1. **style.css:** your website styles, they have to be imported from the index.html
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.js:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.

> Note: The exercises have automatic grading but it's very rigid and strict, my recommendation is to ignore the tests and use them only as a recommendation or you can get frustrated.
